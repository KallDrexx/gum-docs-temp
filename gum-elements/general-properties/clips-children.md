# Introduction

The **Clips Children** property controls whether children of a component or container can render outside of the bounds of their parent. By default this is false, which means that all children can fully-render, regardless of whether they are within the bounds of their parent or not. Setting this value to true will prevent children from rendering outside of the bounds of their parent.
