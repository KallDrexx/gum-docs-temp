## Introduction

Gum is an open source project so you can run it from source instead of running the pre-compiled project.

## Obtaining the source code

1. If you want to download the source:
	1. Download the source file from the "Source Code" link
	1. Unzip the file
1. Otherwise if you want to run from the repository:
	1. Check the project out locally using TFS or SVN from CodePlex

## Running the code

1. Locate the .sln file in the unzipped location
1. Double-click it to open Visual Studio, or open Visual Studio and load the .sln
1. Run the build configuration in "x86".  The build configuration may default to "Mixed Platforms". If you do not change it Gum will not compile.
