# Introduction

An InstanceSave represents an instance in Gum.  InstanceSave only stores two pieces of information:

1. The name of the instance
1. The base type of the instance

All InstanceSaves in Gum will be contained in an [ElementSave](Gum.DataTypes.ElementSave).  Information about the InstanceSave's variables (such as its position or size) is not stored directly on the InstanceSave.  The reason for this is because InstanceSaves have variables which depend on [States](Gum.DataTypes.StateSave).  In other words, an InstanceSave may be at X=0 in one state, and at X=100 in another state.

Therefore, all variables values that define the InstanceSave are stored in states within the InstanceSave's container [ElementSave](Gum.DataTypes.ElementSave).

# Example

In this pic the Screen1 ScreenSave has 3 InstanceSaves:
1. TextInstance
1. ColoredRectangleInstance
1. ColoredRectangleInstance1

# Simple variable access

The following code shows how to access the X value of an ElementSave as defined in the default state of its container.

```
var container = SelectedState.Self.SelectedScreen;
// This code gets an instance by the name "Title"
var instance = container.Instances.FirstOrDefault(item=>item.Name == "Title");

var defaultState = container.DefaultState;

// We'll assume that "instance" is valid, and get its X value:
var xVariable = defaultState.Variables.FirstOrDefault(item=>item.Name == "Title.X");
float xValue = 0;
if(xVariable != null)
{
   xValue = (float)xVariable.Value;
}
```
